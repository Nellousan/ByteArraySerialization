## Description

(this project is a work in progress and isn't really "distributable" yet)\
\
Multi-purpose byte array serialisation lib for C++ classes or any type of data.\
This lib provide a mean to easily serialize classes for networking purpose or to save them into binary file (even though you're probably better using json or xml in this case)\
\
Here is a preview of how it works:
